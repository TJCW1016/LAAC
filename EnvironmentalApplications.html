                <h2>How can computer science help our environment?</h2>
                <p>Technology can be used to create computer models using scientific data,<!-- semi colon -->these models can help environmentalists 
                monitor changes to our planet.</p>
                <br>
                <h3><u>Monitoring climate change</u></h3>
                <p>Using a combination of past and present data, climate models can be constructed to help us monitor
                current atmopsheric conditions and predict how they may change in the future. It is important that we are aware
                of gas emissions, concentration of PM2.5 in the atmopshere and the rate of coal combustion and
                deforestation so that we are in a position of control and can therefore make improvements wehre possible that will 
                positively affect the health of out planet. It is only with the help of satellite technology and computer software 
                that we are able to monitor these changes to our environment.</p>

                <h3><u>Monitoring storm paths</u></h3>
                <p>GIS (Geographical Information Systems) tools provide us with real-time, computerized information that allows us
                to track tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones. These kind of weather events can put people's lives and 
                property in danger and so it is massively important that we monitor storm behaviour and evacuate the areas under 
                potential threat. The physical laws which control the behaviour of the storms can be explained by mathematical
                equations, by monitoring varibales such as temperature, wind speed and and humidity, we can use computers to construct
                3-dimensional models that can predict the behaviour of the storm in the future i.e. what area the storm will travel 
                to next and the severity of the storm at that point.</p>

                <h3><u>Energy</u></h3>
                <p>Computer Science can help reduce how much energy we consume in numerous ways. One example is the development of
                smartphone applications that encourage users to monitor how much electricity they are using in their homes. These 'green
                apps' track energy usage and give advice on how to reduce energy consumption at home. Some examples include Smappee, 
                MeterPlug and Neurio. Computer Science can also play an important role in the development of renewable energy, big data 
                analytics is used to maximise wind energy to help find the optimum time for the wind turbines to be switched on. The 
                Internet of Things allows the solar and wind farms to be monitored in real time by installing fully-integrated systems,
                this can be used to automate the technologies making energy generation more efficient.</p>

                
                <h3><u>Machine learning for wildlife</u></h3>
                <p>As more and more species become endangered, it becomes increasingly important to track these animals in their
                natural habitats. 24 hour camera traps are used to monitor wildlife, in the past humans would analyse these images
                and manually record which species of animla could be seen on the recording. This process took time and was very 
                inefficient, since then this process has been automated through the use of machine learning, thus greatly speeding 
                up the process of monitoring habitats. Machine learning algorithms have been developed that can successfully identify 
                certain animal and plant species from videos and images recorded by camera traps, it has been said that these
                machine learning algorithms are able to perform with the same accuracy as humans. </p>
