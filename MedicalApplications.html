				<p>Out of all the ways technology has improved in the last few centries, none are as important as the technological advances in medicine improving the lives of humans across the globe. From the early invention of the X-ray machines to advances in surgical practices, technology has made us healthier and increased the quality of life of people whom are made avalaible to the healthcare. <!-- 'to whom the healthcare is made available' or 'who have access to the healthcare' --> As the technology improves as we move further into the 21st century,<!-- 'as we move into the 21st century and our technology improves' --> we continue to develop technologies that cure illnesses and improve our quality of life.
				<p>In the last few decades the rate of expansion in technology has increased exponentially, with new inventions & techniques constantly being improved & made better. Technology is only going to improve in the upcoming years & the medical practices will become more efficent and more efficent.
